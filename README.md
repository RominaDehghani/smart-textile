2.	Project Description:
 The purpose of this project is the detection of smoke and natural gas leaks. Smoke or natural gas leakage is a serious problem that can significantly impact human life and even cause death. At the same time, when people are not at home, but gas leakage occurs, we aimed to create a solution for early intervention to prevent incidents like explosions. Additionally, the system will inform the landlord and relevant authorities in a timely manner for natural gas leak emergency situations.
